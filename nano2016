Scherzer woke her up with his motorcycle-engine purr right in her ear and his pressure point paws in the midle of her chest. His cream colored face rammed into her chin
when she took more than a moment to open her eyes and acknowledge him. She couldn't reach up and pet him - one arm was acting as her pillow while two cats were stretched
back to back baetween her side and other arm. She could feel the weight of one, no two, more cats on her legs. It must have been a warm night, she though groggily. Or
Scherz Hulked his way to king of the mountain and I missed it. 

Scherzer was now cleaning his left paw, still purring up a storm. He didn't actually need anything, just someone notice he was there and now he had a comfy warm mattress
on a mattress to take a nap.

Jen stared at the bottom of the cat cubbies above her for awhile, letting Scherzer's purr lull her back into a doze. The mattress was an old toddler bed that someone had
donated to the shelter and it was by no means comfortable, but she made due. The staff that volunteered to care for the cats changed the sheets at night and in the morning
and she certainly never lacked for warmth. It wasn't even terrible having to be awake and out of the shelter before the sun came up, in order to avoid pointed questions from
the retired ladies on the first shift. She was definitely never late for work.  

She cast her eyes down to her left and could see, just barely, the tops of two heads tucked against the inner part of her arm on one side and her rib cage on the other.
Judging by the coloring, one was Bangle, the fiesty little girl who was just starting to warm up to the other volunteers, while the other was Taco Cat, the even tinier
goofball who was enamoured of Bangle while also being her polor opposite. She couldn't tell who was on her legs, but there was a short list of possible suspects. Grey
and white Big Daddy, skinny from a bought with IBS, or tiny Tailula, all 9 pounds of her. Anecdotal evidence suggested that these were the most likely, but there were
also 60 other cats in the shelter. 

The sky outside the windows was turning grey when she opened her eyes again. Scherzer's purrs had settled into a deep, even breathing and Bangle and Taco Cat had both
left their posts. Her legs were cold, which meant it was down to just Scherzer. That didn't mean much, since he tipped the scales at 18 pounds, but he was easy enough to
roll off onto the bed. The purr started up again as he stretched himself out and went back to sleep. 

She sat up and slipped her feet back into her sneakers. Here came tiny Tailula, trotting in from the other room, already meowing. Behind her were a half dozen other cats
all ready to remind her that it was coming dangerously to breakfast and she was still in bed. 

Downstairs, she waded through a herd of cats gathering outside the feeding room door and got into an argument with Frank, who asserted, as always, that it was his right
o accompany her into the feeding room. In the end, her shoe one as it nudged him back from the door just far enough that she could slip in and close the door behind her.
Frank stood on his back paws and meowed his annoyance through the screen. 

She took a minute to pull back her hair and splash water on her face while listening for the front lobby door to open. None of the other volunteers knew she had been
essentially squatting in the shelter overnight and even if they did, she took pains to at least look like she had a home to come from in the mornings. A few people
had commented on how early she came to her shifts but she just told them it was a function of Grand Rapids horrible bus timetables. She had also cut her volunteer hours
down to only two days a week from every other day, to coincide with the start of the new school year. Not that she was actually attending any of the high schools in town 
but she did use the extra hours to study for her GED, so it was kind of the same. 

Rafael found her mixing canned pate with water using the stick blender and wisher her a good morning over the whir of the stick blender and the continued cries from, as
he called them, the Hungry Inmates. He grabbed a plastic bucket, a plastic grocery bag and a litter scoop, saluted her with a grave look on his pale face, and slipped 
out the door. He could be heard having a repeat argument with Frank as he tried to make his way the first of many, many litter boxes that needed scooping after a long
night. 

She was setting out pans on the floor for the cat food slop when Heidi breezed in, red hair piled on her head in a messy bun and wearing a GVSU sweater off one shoulder.
She scooped up Frank with a loud coo and snuggled her face into his side even as he protested.

"He has ringworm," Jen said, raising an eyebrow. Heidi grinned, letting Frank drop back to the floor. 

"That's okay, there's creams for that kind of thing," she answered. She took a stack of pans from Jen's hands and started up the stairs to the second floor. Heidi was on
board for cat meds and general cat care for the shift, but she also, willingly, took on whatever other tasks she could do to try and make the other volunteers lives easier.

Kandice had no issues coming in through the feeding room door, as all of the most eager cats had gathered around to gobble up the slop Jen had poured into the two pans in
the kitchen, or were following Jen into the next room over to see what she put in that pan. Kandice followed her as well, but her task was pulling sheets from the cots
and fleece pads from the shelves and cat cubbies. She cooed at Wanda as she gently evicted the elderly cat to the floor from the fleece pad she had been sleeping on. She
caught Jen's eye and shook her head. 

"She's not getting any better, is she?" she asked, watching Wanda curl into a small ball against the wall. When Jen had first begun volunteering at the shelter, Wanda had been
twice the weight she was now, active and goofy. Now she was nearly skin and bones, brought down by stomatitis secondary to feline immunodeficiency virus. All of the cats
in the shelter had it - or feline leukemia or both- but it was always painful to watch as a cat succumbed. 

"Only time will tell," Jen said, upending the last little bit of slop in her pitcher onto the tray on the floor. She smiled at Kandice. "Wanda's come back from being sick
before, we'll just have to keep loving on her until she gets, as they say, her poop in a group."

"No, no more poop," said Raefael, setting his bucket on the ground by the doorway. "I need to start a second bucket - has anyone heard from Nico?"

"Not a word," said Kandice. With one last look at Wanda, she picked up her pile of sheets and fleece pads and carried them to the washer in the next room. 

"Ugh, he's probably hungover again." Jen followed Rafael into the feeding room, nudging Frank aside again so they could get into the room unmolested. 
g 
"Hungover? It's only Tuesday." She began to pull down more cans of cat food from the shelves, stacking them on the counter in fives. Five canes of pate and five cans of water made enough
slop for two rooms of pans and she had 8 room left to do - plus a list of cats that needed to be fed by themselves because they were too scared to try and wade through the
herd to the trays. 

"Are you serious?" Rafael asked from the supply room. "Jen, it's Thursday, not Tuesday." She paused in her stacking and took a moment to try and reconcile her mental calendar. 
How had she lost two days? It was harder to keep track of days since she had dropped her other two shifts. Her schedule of get up, catch the bus to the library, do her
online classes, catch the noon bus to her job at the bookstore, close up the store, catch the two busses it took to get back up to the shelter - everything kind of bled 
together.

"Yeah, but still - it's Thursday! That's not a normal day to be hungover anyway."

"Nico is not your normal party boy, now is he?" Rafael had prepped two more buckets and left one on the counter with a clean scoop stuck inside. "If his fratiness shows up,
tell him I'm upstairs scooping. He can hang around and do last scoop." 

"Will do," said Jen and willed Nico to show his Eurotrash face. If he was a no-show, that meant she would have to stay and help and she needed extra study time this morning.

Jen has finished serving up slop to the downstairs rooms and was making another batch of slop to start upstairs when Nico did finally show up, skin sallow, blonde tipped hair
dishevled and wearing dark sunglasses. He grunted a good morning at her and eyed the untouched bucket with some trepidation. 

"I'm not scooping," he said. She shrugged. 

"Take it up with Rafael. He's the shift lead." Grumbling, Nico grabbed a broom and dustpan and shuffled off into the next room. "Put the wash in the dryer!" Jen called
after him. 

She passed Heidi on the stairs on her way up. The redhead was laden with a bucket of pills, creams and baby wipes, as well as a cat hanging off one shoulder. Jen didn't
recognize the butt and Heidi laughed when she saw the confusion on Jen's face. 

"John Monroe," she answered. "Apparently this drool monster thought I needed a shower."

"Aww, shower of love," said Jen as Heidi squeezed passed her. She stopped on the next stair down to left Jen scratch John Monroe's ears. True to form, drool was dripping 
from his toothless mouth. 

"I hope you're planning on taking a real shower before work," said Jen. Heidi laughed.

Between the five of them, all of the daily chores were completed well before Jen needed to catch her bus but she ended up accepting a ride from Heidi instead. By bus, it was
a 45 minute ride to the campus downtown campus of Grand Rapids Community College, but Heidi could get her there in five. Most normal drivers weren't supposed to get there in
five, but Heidi drove like she was being chased by Saturn Vue devoring zombies. Jen appreciated the extra jolt of adrenline - she had a test today. 

The test was math, pre-calc. She started at the cover of the book and smoothed her fingers along the edges. 

*No one in this family is smart enough to learn all that! You're wastign your time!* No, not smart enough, but she was first in her class and set the curve on all tests. Her prof had
even recommended her to be a tutor in the fall. 

"I *am* smart enough," she whispered to herself. She moved her book to the side and logged into the online classroom. 

She was still grinning when she stepped off the bus in front of the Biggby where she worked the afternoon shift. This was one of the slower Biggby coffee shops in the city,
especially after all of the office professionals went home, but she was on salary so it didn't matter. 

She paused outside the door to make sure she had gotten off all the cat hair before she had left the shelter. She kept a change of clean clothes in the manager's office locker in the
manager's office, but cat hair was but had still had the occasional issue with cat hair in a customer's skim no-foam grande Caramel Mocha (or, in the real world,
a 20 oz Caramel marvel with skim milk instead of 2%).

"Yo, boss lady!" Cameron was petite, skinny and ambiguous as a baby sea turtle. Jen only knew that his reproductive bits were, well, male, because she'd read his resume
before he was hired. The majority of the time, he dressed stylishly male but today he was rocking a strict boho look, including braiding his bangs and clipping them back from his face
She gave him a wave before disappearing into the manager's office to locate her clothes. 

The manager's office was, in a word, destroyed.Usually it was just a disaster, an assortment of half unpacked boxes of supplies, piles of unfiled paperwork, empty drink cups
and a constantly growing pile of coats and sweatshirts, cast off before shift start and forgotten. Today, however, everything was everywhere - the broken table that
served as a desk had been pushed over, spilling papers across the floor. Several months worth of half drank coffee formed assorted, rank smelling puddles and the plastic trash can
had been crushed between a jug of caramel sauce. The manager's locker door hung open, bent where someone had forced something, like a crowbar, between the door and the frame. 
It was empty. She took a deep breath

"Cameron, what in the absolute fuck!" Back out in the lobby, Camerone was handing a large iced drink to a young woman with big blue eyes that somehow grew bigger when 
She came around the corner. Cameron maintained his calm and onyl raised an eyebrow. 

"Did Siobhan dump creme freeze on your jeans again?" She grabbed his arm and pulled him the back room, thankful it was only 2pm and there were no customers. Cameron gaped
when he saw the office. 

"Was this like this when you got here?" He shook his head. 

"I don't know. I didn't even come back here - I just took Justin's apron from him and clocked in up front. I've been tripping over my hoodie all day." He nudged a box with his foot
"Do we call the police?"

"I think we should - and Siobhan too. Did she open this morning?" cameron shook his head. 

"Funny you should mention that - Justin said she was on shift but didn't show, so he had to call in Logan and Marisol to help with the morning rush."

"Es no bueno, mi amore."
